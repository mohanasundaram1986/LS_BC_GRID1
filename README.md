This script is for bias correcting GCM monthly precipitation data with linear scaling technique.

Run the function file (ls_bc.R) before you run the main script file (main_script1.R)

Inputs to the scripts: 
1.Gridded observed precipitation (p1): You have to replace the local PC url of your observed gridded dprecipitation data
2.Gridded GCM raw precipitation (p2): You have to replace the local PC url of your raw GCM precipitation gridded data

Outputs:
1. Bias corrected gridded precipitation
